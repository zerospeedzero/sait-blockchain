Overview
========

I designed and implemented an NFT marketplace and a collection for SAIT NMPD classmates in the first semester. I targeted to demonstrate the values of blockchain networking using NFT as an example. The following are the major benefits of the solution.

1.  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the digital asset landscape by leveraging smart contracts on the blockchain network. These unique tokens are created and transacted according to well-defined standards, ensuring transparency and trust among participants.
2.  By utilizing NFTs, my solution ensures rock-solid ownership records and provenance tracking, safeguarding the unique value of student graphic assets and minimizing the risk of unauthorized use or plagiarism.
3.  With the SAIT NFT marketplace built on blockchain tech, students can directly sell their graphic assets to buyers, eliminating intermediaries and unnecessary fees, and ensuring transparent and secure transactions that empower students.
4.  The NFT marketplace opens up exciting opportunities for students to showcase their graphic assets to a global audience, increasing exposure and attracting potential buyers from around the world, expanding their creative horizons.
5.  The smart contracts (generated in Thirdweb) associated with NFTs empower students to receive ongoing royalties from subsequent sales, ensuring they benefit from the increasing value of their graphic assets, even after the initial sale, creating a fair and sustainable ecosystem for our talented students.

NFT SAIT marketplace
--------------------

1.  In this cutting-edge project, I have developed a Web 3.0 application hosted on the Azure Cloud platform, providing a curated listing of my exclusive NFT products. My NFT graphic products showcase the exceptional work from the Visual Communication and Web Communication courses.
2.  Central to this application are two pre-defined smart contracts: "Marketplace" and "NFT Collection." The "Marketplace" smart contract supports NFTs in both ERC721 and ERC1155 formats, enabling seamless listing and auctioning of our NFTs. To make these products accessible to the public, the "Marketplace" smart contract must be deployed as a transaction on the selected blockchain network. As an illustration, I have deployed the "SAIT NFT" marketplace on the Goerli network, which serves as a testing blockchain network for developers on Ethereum. Consequently, any participant on this blockchain network gains visibility into my NFT listings and auctions via the unique address "0x75B9cb48afE6D68Dc4ed40e79741eA8Ca71AC02d" associated with the NFT "Marketplace."
3.  Additionally, I have utilized the "NFT Collection" smart contract to group NFTs for selling or auctioning purposes. These collections serve as another type of smart contract on the blockchain network. As an example, I have introduced the "VisualCommunication" NFT collection within the marketplace to showcase my assets from the Visual Communication assignments. Ownership of these NFTs is attributed to specific account addresses, which will be elaborated on in a subsequent section.
4.  Embracing NFTs and blockchain technology, owners of graphic design assets now enjoy unparalleled accessibility to potential buyers, with robust digital ownership protection. Most notably, this technology significantly reduces the total cost of ownership required to set up an eCommerce platform, thereby offering considerable advantages to small startup graphic design companies and freelancers alike.
